# Rust Analysis

This package utilizes the algorithms found [here](https://github.com/dguo/strsim-rs).

To run the benchmarks simply run:

`make bench`

The rust crate [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) is used for this benchmarking and it outputs great statistical charts for easy analysis. To view the charts after running the benchmarks, simply run:

`make report`
