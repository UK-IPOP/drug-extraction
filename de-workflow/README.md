# DE Workflow

This is a small wrapper program around the [drug-extraction-cli](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction/tree/main/cli) program.

It is effectively a convenience wrapper for us and our typical use-case.

Benefits over the standard CLI:

- Multi-column support (it _expects_ two columns -- a primary and a secondary)
- Wide form data created automatically
- Wide form data attached to source data ready for analysis
- Automated report generation
- Use of either our/your custom search template _with tags!_

It can generate a nice report using [datapane](https://github.com/datapane/datapane) for some quick eye-ball analysis.

It uses `data/drug_info.json` ([link](data/drug_info.json)) as our template for custom search words **with tags**. This can be extended or edited where you can provide ANY custom search file you want as long as it matches our format. Alternatively you can enable `--live` mode and just use ours ðŸ™‚.

## Requirements

- [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
- [drug-extraction-cli program](../cli/README.md)

## Installation

You can install this program with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
pipx install de-workflow
```

You can then easily get help for the only command (execute) like so:

```bash
de-workflow execute --help
```

Which should look something like this:

## Usage

To run this tool all you will need to know is:

- The name of your file
- Your ID column for linking
- Your Target column(s) to search in

You can then run the tool:

```bash
de-workflow execute ../cli/data/records.csv "Case Number" "Primary Cause" "Secondary Cause"
```

This will run the underlying drug extraction program so you **MUST** have the main [CLI](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction/tree/main/cli) tool installed.

There are additional flags for reporting and custom file searching.

`--report/--no-report` identifies whether or not to produce a `datapane` report at the end. Suggested and default value is `--report`.

`--live/no-live` identifies whether or not you want you use our [template](data/drug_info.json).

If you do **NOT** want to use our template, you can disable live (`--no-live`) but you then MUST provide a custom `--search-file` for the program to use. This file should be in `json` format and match the structure of our template so that the tool can work correctly.
