# Road Map

## TODOs

- Add support for slang (street names)
- Handle all ignored errors
- Adjust drug_info.yaml config based on output analysis
- Update go-docs
  - Add docstrings
- Add tests
- Think of data structure for tags themselves
  - ie. tree structure
- Refactor util functions into their command files, makes more sense than separation
- Problem with clean status from server, bool should be true but is not.
- Add strict flag to server
- simplify --format and --format-type commands into just the --format command w/ a type provided
- fix navigation order in docs
- add bugs section, or make issues in GH
- decide if commands and flags should be re-documented on web or just exist in CLI
  - yes they should, but do it in a global sense not command-by-command
- fill out readme
