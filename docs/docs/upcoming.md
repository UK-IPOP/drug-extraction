# Road Map

I have a few ideas for new features to the tool:

1. Report to generate summary statistics with output type web or pdf.
2. Improve server UI and performance (timeout).

Other than that there are a few [Issues](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction/issues) that are more pressing first.

If you would like to contribute please visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction) page and submit a PR!

## TODOs

- Adjust drug_info.yaml config based on output analysis
- improve tags?
- Update go-docs
  - Add docstrings
- Add tests

- Refactor util functions into their command files, makes more sense than separation
- Add strict flag to server
- fill out readme
