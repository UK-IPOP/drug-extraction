# Road Map

I have a few ideas for new features to the tool:

1. Report to generate summary statistics with output type web or pdf.
2. Improve server UI and performance (timeout).
3. Adjust API to flexible/dynamic
   1. Ideally this would mean the search file is customizable and this package could be applied to any text searching not just drugs.

Other than that there are a few [Issues](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction/issues) that are more pressing first.

If you would like to contribute please visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction) page and submit a PR!
