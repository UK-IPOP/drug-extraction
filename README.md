This project uses string similarity metrics to detect drugs inside text records.

Researchers at the University of Kentucky had a need for a simple, fast, intuitive interface to extract drug mentions in text records. This project takes text records and detects drug mentions (including misspellings) and then extracts the drug and the corresponding record for analysis.

### Built With

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) ðŸ¦€
- [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) ðŸ•¸
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

In order to set clear expectations for the development of the toolbox and to keep feature requests in scope it is good to set some guidelines.

What this project IS:

- A suite of tools to extract drug mentions from text records
- A string parsing tool
- A website

What this project is NOT:

- An analytical tool
- A business intelligence tool
- A preprocessing tool

We've chosen to utilize a mono-repo format for this project. This is our first implementation of the mono-repo structure when using Rust. If it causes more problems than benefits, we will switch to independent repositories for each project.

This toolbox contains multiple projects:

- A command line tool (available via cargo install)
- A core Rust library for parsing strings and comparing them to common drugs
  - This is also configurable for custom search options and integration with the popular [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) library from the National Library of Medicine ([NLMS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov))
  - This also contains web assembly bindings
- A website utilizing the core Web Assembly bindings

> **The command-line application will always be given priority bug and feature support as it is the most versatile. The website will always come second as it is simply a thin interface-wrapper around the CLI/Core libraries for non-technical researchers. Core library development will be driven _strongly_ by the needs of the CLI and thus may introduce breaking changes so please be sure to pin your version.**
>
> For more information, consult the corresponding tool's documentation [CLI](cli/README.md) -- [Core](core/README.md) -- [Web](web/README.md). ðŸ˜ƒ

We utilize string similarity algorithms as defined and implemented by [Danny Guo](https://github.com/dguo) in the [str-sim](https://github.com/dguo/strsim-rs) package. For more information on string similarity algorithms, please consult [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric) Wikipedia page for a **comparison/list** of algorithms and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) page for an explanation of string metrics more generally.
