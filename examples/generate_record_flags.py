# **IMPORTANT**
# This script assumes the output of the search command that you run
# (via subprocess command or another way) fits into memory. It will
# need to be modified to work with a large dataset.
# -------------
# This script is somewhat created for our use case but should be general
# enough to be adopted. It is required because I couldn't find an alternate
# way (for example, using joins) to get the same output (binary flags
# for terms and meta-categories at the row level). If you have an idea how to
# improve the script or how to get the same results using simpler methods
# (i.e. a join) please
# [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/UK-IPOP/drug-extraction/issues) ðŸ™‚.
# We use that script frequently so any help is welcomed.
#
# This script also showcases how to use python subprocess module to run
# the main CLI, although that code is commented out to not overwrite the
# existing `data/output.csv` file.
